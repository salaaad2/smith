* Smith
Smith is a very good friend of mine, and a robot
His purpose is to make me money, or as we call it in France, *Cesterces*....

** Building
Just type
src_bash[build]{make}
And you will have a very nice executable called smith

** Usage
You will find at the source of this repository a file called *default.json*, in which you must insert the correct value to be able to use this program
Given how early in production this program is, you might feel a little restricted in what you can ask my good friend to do. Don't worry, traveller... Enjoy the ride and the view
